1. Install a version of aioquic with delay bit and python.
	To install the version with the delay bit, install regular aioquic, replace the aioquic folder with
	our modified folder and then open command prompt, traverse to our aioquic implementation folder and run
	the command `pip install -e .`
2. Clone the QRED repository - https://github.com/DaduMord/LCCN_Delay_Bit_RTT_Estimator
	(this is the delay bit based tool)
3. Follow the instructions in the repository's README to install wireshark and pyshark
	(make sure you are installing Pyshark version 0.4.5)
4. Clone the QRE repository - https://github.com/DaduMord/LCCN-QUIC-Spin-Bit
	(this is the spin bit based tool)
5. Apply Netem (instructions can be found at https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/netem).
	Please notice that you will need to find the name of the interface you are using with the
	`ifconfig` command and use the interface name instead of `eth0`.
	You will also need admin privelages.
6. Run the QRE, QRED and create a QUIC connection (using aioquic's examples). Stop the QRE and QRED (using Ctrl+C) to print the logs.

Notes:
- The QRE needs to be run from the main repository context. go to `LCCN-QUIC-Spin-Bit` directory and run the command
	`python QRE\QRE.py`.
- If you are using PyCharm for the QRE or QRED, notice that you will have to emulate terminal in output console.
	Do this through Edit Configurations option.
- To disable Netem you will need to manually disable your changes.
	For example, if you used netem to emulate a 100ms extra delay, to disable it you will need to emulate 0ms extra delay
	(using the same command with a different value).
