Estimate RTT using Delay bit and Spin bit

	1. For no loss, delay or reorder (should be same estimate)
	
	2. With reordering and no delay or loss
		- Delay bit measurements should be more accurate
		
	3. With delay and no loss or reordering
		- Should be less delay bit measurements
		- Delay bit measurements should be more accurate
		
	4. Packet loss:
		- Increasing rate (0%, 25%, 50%) of sporadic packet loss
		- Increasing rate (0%, 25%, 50%) of burst packet loss
